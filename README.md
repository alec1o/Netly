## Abount

> Netly is a low-level socket library whose main function is to make socket usage easier, readable and productive. Its syntax is minimalistic and inspired by [socket.io](https://socket.io). It supports using TCP/UDP and Client/Server. The reason for the emergence was aimed at building a multiplayer game server.

## Documentation
> This project from two sources of documentation.

- It's a documentation generated by [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx) (a tool that generates documentation based on source code), it's good to see little explored methods and it's an X-ray of the project.
<br>[Look here.](http://docs-netly.kezero.com)

- It is a didactic code whose purpose in teaching is to show how to use a resource. It's good for a refresher, we used [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com) for its creation. unlike the [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx) version it is not just a class reference, but the instructor where it covers some topic to make something clear, and more.

## Package manager
> This library can be found in some package managers, see below

- Nuget / [SEE HERE]() (not found)
- Unity AssetStore / [SEE HERE](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/225473)

## Platforms

### Build Platforms (RUNTIME)

### Note
> Netly is a native script and runs on all .NET C# projects (e.g: Console Application, Xamarin) or projects that contain dotnet C# as a script (e.g: Game Engine), as described below some of the famous platforms that netly can be used.

### Attention
> Despite running on platforms with C# as base or scripting language, it can be installed in different ways, e.g:
- In Unity Engine (we can just add the dlls already compiled in a directory in the unity project and it will already be installed);
- In the Console Application (We can add the dlls link as a project reference in the .csproj file and it will also be already there)
- Nuget (We can also use the dotnet package manager "Nuget" to be able to add/install it in our project. It is the most recommended if possible)

### Summary
> We saw that we can install it in several places, but the installation can vary a lot from platform, but after the installation the usability is the same (Simple, Minimalist, and Robust).

### Platform List
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) (SDK)
- [Mono](https://mono-project.com) (SDK)
- [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/xamarin) (SDK)
- [Unity](https://unity.com) (Engine)
- [FlaxEngine](https://flaxengine.com) (Engine)
- [MonoGame](https://monogame.net) (Engine)
